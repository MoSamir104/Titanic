Titanic
The Titanic project involves predicting passenger survival on the RMS Titanic using machine learning. It analyzes factors like age, sex, and ticket class to build models that estimate survival likelihood. By examining patterns in historical data, the project aims to understand survival determinants and create models applicable to similar scenarios.
